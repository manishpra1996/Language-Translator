Language Translation using Python with Google APIs :-
A language translator is a very handy application that helps us to communicate in different languages by translating our language to the desired language. In earlier times, when there were no Language Translation Applications, it was very difficult for people to communicate with people coming from different parts of the world. Today we can create our own language translation project using Python.
ðŸ’¡ 
Our objective is to create a Language Translator which would help us translate a word, sentence, or even a paragraph to another language.

We will be using Tkinter Module to build our GUI for the project and googletrans library to present us with a number of languages that are a part of it. Also, we will use the TextBlob library for processing textual data.

Project Prerequisites:
pip install tk
pip install -U textblob
pip install googletrans
